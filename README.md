This project is a real-time video call application using React, Socket.io, and WebRTC. Users can join a lobby by providing their email and room number. Once connected to a room, users can initiate video calls with others in the same room. The video call functionality is facilitated by the WebRTC technology, and Socket.io is used for real-time signaling between users. The project consists of three main components: "LobbyScreen" for joining rooms, "RoomPage" for video calls, and "PeerService" to handle WebRTC peer connections. The server is built using Node.js and Socket.io to manage room connections and signaling. Overall, it enables users to have real-time video conversations within the same room.
